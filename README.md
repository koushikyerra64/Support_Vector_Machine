# Support_Vector_Machine
This program demonstrates how to build a binary image classifier (Cats vs Dogs) using: * Synthetic dataset created inside the program (so no external files are required). * HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features for image representation. * SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification.
